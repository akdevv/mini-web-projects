                            The first Iron Man suit, the Mark-I was created from Jericho missile parts by Tony Stark and
                            fellow captive Ho Yinsen while they were being held captive in a cave in Afghanistan.<br>
                            The suit was designed as a pacemaker to keep shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart, and as in
                            the movie, was used to escape his captors.

                            U.S. Military and was converted into the War Machine Mark I before Tony got it back and
                            reverted it to the Mark II.
